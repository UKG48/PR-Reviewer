## Introduction
- This project aims to utilize OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to assist PR reviewers in analyzing code changes and providing feedback to developers on GitHub pull requests.

## THE IDEA - OPTIMIZE OUR WAYS OF WORKING
- A PR code review takes anywhere between 6 hours to 48 hours depending on the volume and complexity of changes
- We need a solution which can review files which are added or updated as part of a PR (as a whole and specific code that has changed) and provide review comments and recommendation for merge.

## Our Approch 
- Rely on existing OpenAI model to get a feedback on the code.
- Add custom rules and train model to catch any deviations to that rulecomments and recommendation for merge.
- Large Language Model evaluated
 - 1. Open AI (text-davinci-003 AKA GPT-3)
 - Large Language Model used
 - 1. Open AI (gpt-3.5-turbo)
 
 ## Its Impact
 - The solution will have an immediate impact by catching common problems as listed below:
   - 1. Language specific syntactical errors
   - 2. Adherence to coding standards
   - 3. Provide code performance, complexity and provide suggestions to improve code style and structure
   - 4. Provide errors and also lists suggestions to fix them
 - Custom validation can be added by training the model. Some use cases can be â€“
   - 1. Check for Copyright
 - There are some solutions available in market, but we could not find a production ready solution. Also, given the fact that we would like to add customized rules, we need a customized training of the model.
- The solution can be adopted across the complete development community.

## What features in MVP 
- Review JAVA
- Custom rule to check for Copyright
- Does not reuse conversations

## Future enhancements
- Support for more programming languages
- Translate the diff of pull request into a summary that can be pasted into changelog
- Generate comments on-demand
- Notifications in Slack, per email or via a custom webhook
